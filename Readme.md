# A Virtual Coffee Machine 😉☕

This coffee machine makes 3 types of coffee - *Latte, Espresso & Cappuccino*

It will make you a coffee until it runs out of its resources.

You can give the following 5 inputs to the  program.
* latte
* espresso
* cappuccino
* report - It shows the quanity of different resource that is left to make coffee
* off - To turn off the machine (It stops the program)

Once you choose the coffe you want, the program asks for money in US dollars.

Since it only accepts coins, you can provide you coin values in terms of how many quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.  

If you give additional amount, the machine will give back the balance.👍

>This python program uses the concepts of accessing values from dictionary and using functions to compartmentalize the program.
